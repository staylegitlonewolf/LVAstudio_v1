git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git push origin main
```

**Example:**
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Update index.html with new test message"
git push origin main
```

---

**Note for PowerShell:**  
If you want to run your batch script, use:
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
.\quickpush.bat
```
(The `.\` tells PowerShell to run the script from the current directory.)

---

**Summary:**  
- Use the three git commands above for manual pushes.
- Or use `.\quickpush.bat` for your automated script.
