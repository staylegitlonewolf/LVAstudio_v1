2. Select your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add all required environment variables

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Visit application URL
- [ ] Access Strapi admin at `/admin`
- [ ] Create first admin user

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Application Health
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Strapi admin panel is accessible
